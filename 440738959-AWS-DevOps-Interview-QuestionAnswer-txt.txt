Question 24. What Is Vpc?

Answer :

A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.
You can configure or create your VPC as per requirement like select region, create
subnets (IP- CIDR), configure route tables, security groups, Internet gateway etc
to your AWS account By which you can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2,
RDS instances etc, into your VPC.

So basically you can say that Amazon VPC is the networking layer for AWS
Infrastructure.

Question 25. What Is Vpc Peering?

Answer :

A VPC peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables
you to route traffic between them using private IP addresses. And instances which
are in VPC can communicate with each other as if they are within the same network.
You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in
another AWS account within a single region.
If you have more than one AWS account within a same region and wants to share or
transfer the data, you can peer the VPCs across those accounts to create a file
sharing network. You can also use a VPC peering connection to allow other VPCs to
access resources you have in one of your VPCs.
A VPC peering connection can help you to facilitate the transfer of data.
Question 26. What Is Vpc Endpoints?

Answer :

A VPC endpoint enables you to create a private connection between your VPC with
another AWS service without requiring access over the Internet, through a NAT
device, a VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect. They are horizontally scaled,
redundant, and highly available VPC components that allow communication between
instances in your VPC and AWS services without imposing availability risks or
bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.

An endpoint enables instances in your VPC to use their private IP addresses to
communicate with resources in other services. Don�t require public IP addresses to
your instances, and you don�t need an Internet gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual
private gateway in your VPC.

Question 27. What Is Ebs (elastic Block Storage)?

Answer :

EBS is a virtualized SAN or storage area network. Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)
provides persistence block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS
volumes are highly available and reliable storage volumes that can be attached to
any running instance that is in the same Availability Zone.

Question 28. What Is S3? What Is It Used For? Should Encryption Be Used In S3?

Answer :

Amazon S3 is stand for Simple storage service that is storage for the Internet. It
as a, �simple storage service that offers software developers a highly-scalable,
reliable, and low-latency data storage infrastructure at very low costs�.
Amazon S3 provides a simple web service interface which you can use to store and
retrieve any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web. Using this web
service, developers can easily build applications that make use of Internet
storage.
You can think of it like ftp storage, where you can move files to and from there,
but not mount it like a file system. AWS automatically puts your snapshots there,
as well as AMIs there. Encryption should be considered for sensitive data, as S3 is
a proprietary technology developed by Amazon themselves, and as yet unproven vis-a-
vis a security standpoint.
Encryption should be considered for sensitive data, as S3 is a proprietary
technology developed by Amazon themselves, and yet to be proven from a security
standpoint.
Question 29. What Is An Ami?

Answer :

AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image. It is effectively a snapshot of the root
filesystem. AWS AMI provides the information required to launch an instance, which
is a virtual server in the cloud. You specify an AMI when you launch an instance,
and you can launch as many instances from the AMI as you need. You can also launch
instances from as many different AMIs as you need.

An AMI includes the following:

A template for the root volume for the instance (such as an operating system, an
application server, and applications).
Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch
instances.
A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when
it�s launched.
Build a new AMI by first spinning up and instance from a trusted AMI. Then adding
packages and components as required. Be wary of putting sensitive data onto an AMI.
For instance your access credentials should be added to an instance after spin up.
With a database, mount an outside volume that holds your Mysql data after spin up
as well.

Question 30. What Is The Relation Between Instance And Ami?

Answer :

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) is a template that contains a software configuration
(for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications). From
an AMI, you launch an instance, which is a copy of the AMI running as a virtual
server in the cloud.

You can launch different types of instances from a single AMI. An instance type
determines the hardware of the host computer used for your instance. Each instance
type offers different compute and memory capabilities.

Question 31. What Automation Tools Can You Use To Spin Up Servers?

Answer :

Here below many types tools given any of the following tools can be used:

Roll-your-own scripts, and use the AWS API tools. Such scripts could be written in
bash, Perl or other language or your choice.
Use a configuration management and provisioning tool like Ansible, puppet or its
successor Opscode Chef Etc.
You might also look towards a tool like Scalr. Lastly you can go with a managed
solution such as Right scale.
Question 32. What Are The Different Deployment Models For Cloud?

Answer :

The different models are:
Private Cloud
Public Cloud
Hybrid Clouds
Question 33. What Is Auto-scaling? How Does It Work?

Answer :

Horizontally Scaling
Vertically Scaling
Auto scaling is a feature of AWS which allows you to configure and automatically
provision and spin up new instances without the need for your intervention. You can
do this by setting thresholds and metrics to monitor. When those thresholds are
crossed, a new instance of your choosing will be spun up, configured, and rolled
into the load balancer pool. You�ve scaled horizontally without any operator
intervention!

Vertically Scaling: This is an incredible feature of AWS and cloud virtualization.
Spin up a new larger instance than the one you are currently running. Pause that
instance and detach the root ebs volume from this server and discard. Then stop
your live instance, detach its root volume. Note the unique device ID and attach
that root volume to your new server. And the start it again. You have scaled
vertically in-place!!

Question 34. What Is The Difference Between Scalability And Elasticity?

Answer :

Scalability is the ability of a system to increase the workload on its current
hardware resources to handle variability in demand.

Elasticity is the ability of a system to increase the workload on its current and
additional hardware resources, thereby enabling businesses to meet demand without
investing in infrastructure up-front.

Question 35. List Out Different Layers Which Define Cloud Architecture?

Answer :

There are five layers:

Cloud Controller (CLC)
Walrus
Cluster Controller
Storage Controller (SC)
Node Controller (NC)
Question 36. What Are The Security Laws Which Are Implemented To Secure Data In A
Cloud?

Answer :

Output reconciliation
Input Validation
Security and Backup
Question 37. Why Api�s Have In Cloud Services?
Answer :

Application Programming Interface (API) has the following uses:

It eliminates the need to write fully fledged programs.
It provides the instructions to set up communication between one or more
applications.
It allows easy creation of applications and links the cloud services with other
systems.
Question 38. How Many Data Centers Are Deployed For Cloud Computing? What Are They?

Answer :

There are two data centers in cloud computing:

Containerized Data centers
Low Density Data centers
Question 39. What Is The Security For Amazon Ec2?

Answer :

There are several best practices for secure Amazon EC2. A few of them are given
below:

Use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control access to your AWS
resources.
Restrict access by only allowing trusted hosts or networks to access ports on your
instance.
Review the rules in your security groups regularly, and ensure that you apply the
principle of least
Privilege � only open up permissions that you require.
Disable password-based logins for instances launched from your AMI. Passwords can
be found or cracked, and are a security risk.
Question 40. How Is Buffer Used In Amazon Web Services?

Answer :

Buffer is used to make the system more resilient to burst of traffic or load by
synchronizing different components. The components always receive and process the
requests in an unbalanced way. Buffer keeps the balance between different
components and makes them work at the same speed to provide faster services.

Question 41. What Is The Function Of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud?

Answer :

Amazon Elastic compute cloud also known as Amazon EC2 is an Amazon web service that
provides scalable resources and makes the computing easier for developers.

reducing the overall time.
It provides scalability to the resources and changes its environment according to
the requirement of the user.
It provides varieties of tools to the developers to build failure resilient
applications.
Question 42. What Are The Different Components Used In Aws?

Answer :

The components that are used in AWS are:

Amazon S3: it is used to retrieve input data sets that are involved in making cloud
architecture and also used to store the output data sets that is the result of the
input.
Amazon SQS: it is used for buffering requests that is received by the controller of
the Amazon. It is the component that is used for communication between different
controllers.
Amazon Simple DB: it is used to store intermediate status log and the tasks that
are performed by the user/
Amazon EC2: it is used to run a large distributed processing on the Hadoop cluster.
It provides automatic parallelization and job scheduling.
Question 43. Explain The Function Of An Amazon Ec2 Instance Like Stopping, Starting
And Terminating?

Answer :

Stopping and Starting an instance: When an instance is stopped, the instance
performs a normal shutdown and then transitions to a stopped state. All of its
Amazon EBS volumes remain attached, and you can start the instance again at a later
time. You are not charged for additional instance hours while the instance is in a
stopped state.

Terminating an instance: When an instance is terminated, the instance performs a
normal shutdown, and then the attached Amazon EBS volumes are deleted unless the
volume�s delete On Termination attribute is set to false. The instance itself is
also deleted, and you can�t start the instance again at a later time
